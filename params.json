  "body": "#DOAG PL/SQL Conventions\r\n\r\nThe goal of this DOAG project is to document common best practises for PL/SQL development. It is meant to give you something to think about, with links to get more in-depth information about the subject. It is NOT meant to teach you PL/SQL as such. If you are interested in learning PL/SQL from scratch, start here [Where to start] ( https://www.quora.com/What-features-of-PL-SQL-should-a-beginner-tackler-first/answer/Steven-Feuerstein?srid=xpsn) and here [PL/SQL Tutorial](http://www.plsqltutorial.com) and then consider buying this book [Oracle PL/SQL Programming by Steven Feuerstein](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024859.do). Experienced PL/SQL developers often like this book for reference purposes: [Oracle PL/SQL Language Pocket Reference](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036913.do).\r\n\r\nBefore learning PL/SQL, you should be familiar with SQL. If you are new to SQL, have a look here: \r\n\r\nhttp://philip.greenspun.com/sql and experiment with it at [Oracle Live SQL](http://livesql.oracle.com)\r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering what the heck I'm talking about, have a look here to get an overview of what a database actually is: \r\n\r\nhttp://allthingsoracle.com/oracle-for-absolute-beginners-part-1-databases\r\n\r\n## How can I contribute to this repository?\r\n\r\nYou can request edit access to this repository through GitHub.
