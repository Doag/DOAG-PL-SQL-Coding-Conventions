## How to use



1. Learn how to use Markdown: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
2. Fork the repository, make your changes and create a pull request.
3. Alternative: Request acces to the DOAG-repository

If you are using images in your arcticle, store them in the articles/images folder.

How it works:
All files are markdown (*.md files) and stored in the github-repository. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with a plain text formatting syntax which can be converted to HTML.
After pushing and merging all files in the github-repository, Jekyll (a static site generator) is building a HTML-page.
